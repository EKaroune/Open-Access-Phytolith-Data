# Open-Science-in-Phytolith-Research
Project to assess the state of open science practices in phytolith research.
This project created a data set by identifying articles with primary phytolith data from 16 prominent archaeological and palaeoecological journals in a 10 year period (2009-2018). The same journals and time period was used as the study by Lodwick (2019) so that the state of open science practices in phytolith research could be compared to those in macro-botanical analysis. Data was collected on open access, open data and available metadata.
