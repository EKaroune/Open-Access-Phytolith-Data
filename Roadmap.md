# Roadmap for Open Science in Phytolith Research

**Here are the milestones that I am currently working towards:**

## Milestone 1: Raising awareness through talks/blogs - short term

### Talks:
* Association of Environmental Archaeology (AEA) autumn webinar series on sustainability – 15th September 2020 6pm BST.
* Palaeopercs early career online series – Tuesday 24th November 2020 3pm GMT.
* AEA Open Science Spring meeting – Saturday 24th April 2021.

### Blogs:
* Find locations for potential blogs and contact organisations – British Ecological Society (PalaeoSIG), International Phytolith Society (IPS), Mentoring women and Archaeology and Heritage (MWAH).
* Write blogs for different organisations.
* Publish blogs.

## Milestone 2: Establishing a working group for open science - medium term
* Emailing IPS, AEA and BES to look for collaborators.
* Email researchers directly who already work openly to look for supporters of the project and early adopters.
* Plan a first meeting to gather ideas of how to move forward – online
* Plan second meeting for spring AEA meeting - online

## Milestone 3: Development of training workshop - medium-term
* Research resources
* Contact relevant bodies – PalaeoSIG/AEA to arrange when this could happen.
* Plan workshop and develop resources
* Look for funding for workshop

## Milestone 4: Development of FAIR guidelines for phytolith data – long-term
* Researching other open FAIR data projects
* Literature review on development of FAIR data in life sciences/palaeoecology/archaeology
* Establish working group to start work on guidelines.
* Look for funding for this project – EOSC life science call
* Have meetings to develop guidelines
* Develop resources for implementation of guidelines – online platform for data deposition
* Write article on guidelines
* Give conference talk on guidelines
* Publish article on guidelines
