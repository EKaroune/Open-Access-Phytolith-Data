# Workshop on Open Science

***Coming soon - here you will soon find details of a workshop that is being run to introduce some of the aspects of open science for phytolith researchers, environmental archaeologists and palaeoecologists***

In the meantime, check out these resources that I find really helpful for learning more about open science:

* [FOSTER training courses in open science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) - free courses on all aspects of open science 
* [Open Science Talk podcast](https://site.uit.no/ub/) - this is about all aspects of open science.
* [Centre for Open Science website](https://www.cos.io/) - lots of resources and information to read as well as links to using Open Science Framework.
* [Open Scholarship Knowledge Base](https://www.oercommons.org/hubs/OSKB) - more resources for learning about open science.
