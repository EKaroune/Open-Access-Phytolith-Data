# Contributing to this project
I am very happy that you want to contribute to this project. I am building a working group for open science in phytolith research that you can join to contribute to the different aspects of the project such as giving talks and blogs, developing training materials for other researchers to learn about open science and developing guidelines for data sharing.

If you want to contribute to this project, please contact **Emma Karoune** using my [email](ekaroune@googlemail.com). 

You can also look at the issues on github and make a comment.
