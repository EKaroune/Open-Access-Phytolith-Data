# Contributing to this project
***How I would like you to contribute and what you might like to contribute!***

I am very happy that you want to contribute to this project. I am building a working group for open science in phytolith research that you can join to contribute to the different aspects of the project such as giving talks and blogs, developing training materials for other researchers to learn about open science and developing guidelines for data sharing.

I need more people to look at my milestones and tell me if this is what does need to be done? Are there things I have not included that you think are important? Are there things going on that I don't know about?
